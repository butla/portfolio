My portfolio
============

This repo contains demo projects and links showing what I can create.
My best work so far is, sadly, closed-source, and not owned by me.

For code samples, see `demo-projects` directory.

Links
-----

### [Mountepy](https://github.com/butla/mountepy)
My Python client library for [Mountebank](https://www.mbtest.org/).
Helps with local high-level tests, especially with Docker.

The code didn't change in a long time, but it's still functional and being used.

### [PITowalut.pl](https://pitowalut.pl/)
My minimalist website / product for calculating tax values for PIT-38 (Polish tax from investments, stock trading, etc.).
Entire transaction with the customer takes place on a single page. There's no account setup required.

### [My software talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjve48cYj_U&list=PLajca_K9x0D-DQSIK1SAjOUAyrdzGvYq-&index=3)
I have a lot of thoughts about how software development should be done. Sometimes I do talks about it.

### [bultrowicz.com](https://bultrowicz.com)
My personal website / blog. Runs on a Digital Ocean VM, static files serverd by NGINX.

The code for that is [here](https://github.com/butla/bultrowicz.com).

### [Falcon's testability guide](https://falcon.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/tutorial.html#refactoring-for-testability)
[I introduced](https://github.com/falconry/falcon/pull/934) the "refactoring for testability" section to the docs.
I loved Falcon in the past. It's the cleanest and most readable web framework code I read.

Eventually I moved on from Falcon to AioHTTP to get async (Falcon was sync-only at the time),
and then to FastAPI, to get request validation with type hints.

### [Presentations repo](https://github.com/butla/presentations)
A collection of slides for presentations I've given.
There's been quite a few of these over the years, probably not all of them are there.
But the most important are.

### [Machine setups](https://github.com/butla/machine_setups)
Python code that automates my Manjaro configuration.
It keeps all my laptops behaving like a single machine.
It allows my Raspberry PI with Manjaro to have the same CLI environment.

I know, I should switch to NixOS... I'll do that eventually :)

I used Ansible in the past, but the number of needed custom functions made me switch to bare Python.

### [bravado-falcon](https://github.com/butla/bravado-falcon)
A small library I created a long time ago to augment Falcon web app testing with Swagger / OpenAPI contract tests.
[Bravado](https://github.com/Yelp/bravado) looks outdated and unmaintained, and I moved away from Falcon.

### [Experiments repo](https://github.com/butla/experiments)
A lot of small code snippets showing what I played around with.
